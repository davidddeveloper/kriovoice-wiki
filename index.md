# KrioVoice 🔊🗣️

**KrioVoice** is an open-source initiative to build seamless **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **Speech-to-Text (STT)** systems for the **Krio language**, spoken by millions in Sierra Leone and across West Africa.

Our goal is to make **Krio communication smarter, accessible, and AI-powered**, bringing Krio into the future of language technology.

## 🌍 Why Krio?

Krio is a vibrant Creole language with roots in English and African languages. Despite its widespread usage, it lacks digital resources like:

- ✅ High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems  
- ✅ Accurate Speech-to-Text (STT) models  
- ✅ Publicly available speech datasets  

**KrioVoice aims to fill this gap.**

## 🎯 What We're Building

KrioVoice is developing:

- ✅ A high-quality **Krio speech dataset**
- ✅ Open-source **TTS model** (Tacotron2 / FastSpeech)
- ✅ Open-source **STT model** (Whisper / Wav2Vec2)
- ✅ **Developer-friendly APIs** for Krio speech

All tools will be free and open for the Krio-speaking community.
